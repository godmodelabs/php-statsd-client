=================

PHP client for Etsy's StatsD

Usage
-----

```php
include_once 'lib/StatsD/Client.php'; // or have the SplClassLoader do this
$log = new \StatsD\Client('localhost'); // insert StatsD hostname

$log->timing('pageload', 123);        // in miliseconds
$log->timing('pageload', 123, 0.5);   // supports sampling

$log->start('pageload');
// do stuff
$log->stop('pageload', 0.4);          // utility function (with sampling)

$log->increment('visits');
$log->increment(['users', 'wins']);   // handles multiple stats at once
$log->decrement('users', 0.2);        // supports sampling as well

$log->gauge('cpu-usage', 30, 0.2);    // gauges with sampling work too
```

API
---

If you specify a sampleRate (between 0 and 1) StatsD doesn't get hit on every
log event in order to reduce load but samples up the events that get through so the stats stay correct.

### new \StatsD\Client([$hostname='localhost'])
Returns an instance of the StatsD client bound to `hostname`, from now on referred to as `log`.

### $log->timing($stat, $time [, $sampleRate])
Log `$time` in milliseconds to `$stat`.

### $log->start($stat)
More convenient timing function: Starts timer

### $log->stop($stat [, $sampleRate])
More convenient timing function: Stops timer and logs to StatsD

### $log->increment($stats [, $sampleRate])
Increment the counter(s) at `$stats` by 1.

The parameter `$stats` can either a `string` or an `array`, in case you want to log the same data to different _stats_.

### $log->decrement($stats [, $sampleRate])
Decrement the counter(s) at `$stats` by 1.

The parameter `$stats` can either a `string` or an `array`, in case you want to log the same data to different _stats_.

### $log->gauge($stat, $value [, $sampleRate])
Set the gauge at `$stat` to `$value`.
